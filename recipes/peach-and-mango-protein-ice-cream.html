    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> 
        There's two things fatties and people who workout can agree upon. No, one of them isn't that being obese is a healthy thing, sit down. Anyways, those two things are <strong>1. We all love desserts 
        and sweets.</strong> And <strong>2. We all love ice cream</strong>. So one day, some of those guy with more braincells than the average person come together and engineered a recipe so close to real ice cream it's not uncanny,
        it becomes a dish of its own, and it satisfies both our sweet tooth and protein macros while keeping the calories low. In short, it's goated i ain't gon lie.

        The challenge of this recipe is that you need to invest in two things: protein powder and a portable blender (either a Ninja or Magic Bullet). And this recipe also introduce an ingredient
        some thought to be engineered chemical but is actually natural. Xanthan Gum, which is what makes our smoothie bind like fat molecules in ice cream. Other than that, this recipe is as easy 
        as making scrambled eggs (You do know how to make it right ?)
    </p>

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul>
        <li><em>150g</em> Frozen Mango</li>
        <li><em>150g</em> Frozen Peaches </li>
        <li><em>1 scoop</em> Protein Powder</li>
        <li><em>120ml</em> Milk of choice (or use water if you're a brokie)</li>
        <li><em>1/4 tbsp</em> Xanthan Gum</li>
        <li><em>1/2 tbsp</em> Honey or Stevia (any kind)</li>
        <li><em> Very little</em> Salt (to amplify sweetness)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Instructions </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Combine all ingredients in your blender</strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                For a portable blender, do this in two seperate batches, for a classic family style blender, go all out and serve in portions
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Blend all ingredients together</strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                It is up to your choice to blend it in pulses or one single run. But i recommend going in long pulses, then open to check or scrape anything that sticks
                to the side of your blender so it blends and incorporate evenly. A proper blend with the help of Xanthan Gum will have a <strong><em>consistency 85-90% similar to real ice cream</em></strong>
                while having little to no fat content.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Serve in a bowl or eat from the blender cup as is</strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                Since we're covering the two cases where you either using a portable blender or a home blender, please serve it in a bowl and share it with friends and family when you use a big blender.
                Please understand that as delicious, sweet and low calories as this protein ice cream is, treats and desserts taste best when you share it with your loved ones, savor the flavor and the 
                emotional experience you and people close to you share.
