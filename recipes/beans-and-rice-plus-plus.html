    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> 
        There are days where you straight up dont want to cook at all but still need to hit those calories and protein goals, there are also weeks where you dont want to cook at all
        but you also need to hit those calories and protein goals. Then comes the people like us, who although loves to cook. would rather rot on our couch than actually prepare the 
        ingredients and perform the steps to make the food. Also the busy ones with classes and jobs but they deserve praise, we only criticize people whose lazy (like us). and that's where
        some simple, cheap, preservable and conveniently microwavable beans and rice with extra proteins comes into play. Because there will be days, or even weeks where all we need is nutrients
        and dog food is starting to look like some kinda 5 star Ekiben (which doesnt exist at all because who makes that ?)
    </p>

    <p>
        The challenge here is that there is no challenge. Or rather the challenge here is that we must be able to get up off our ass, go to the store and buy ingredients, prepare them a few hours
        beforehand to cook (which, assuming youre on the weekends). Then we wont need to eat Hot Pockets or wasting double digits Doordashing food that exceeds our calorie limit (for the week because we have cheat days)
    </p>

    <h2> Ingredients (serves 5) </h2>

    <ul>
        <li><em>200g</em> Dried beans of your choice, at the time of writing this recipe i got black beans at home</li>
        <li><em>250g</em> Cooked rice (can be replaced with brown or cauliflower rice, it's okay i'm not judging out loud) </li>
        <li><em>30ml</em> Olive oil</li>
        <li><em>6</em> Chicken Sausages</li>
        <li><em>250g</em> Frozen Mixed Vegetables</li>
        <li><em>6</em> Large Eggs</li>
        <li><em>100g</em> Canned Lentils</li>
        <li><em>1/2 tbsp</em> Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Instructions </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Preparing the raw ingredients</strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                The first step will be the hardest one. But without it, you'll be eating pebbles, so bear with me. In a Bowl, add in your dry beans and soak it in water until you want to cook,
                which a prerequisite is that you must cook it within the day that you prep it. Then cook your rice in a rice cooker, or using a pot or just use instant rice if you're that lazy
                (again, im judging subconciously). Cut the sausages and maybe parboil the frozen veggies (not really raw but assuming you're in flow when doing this). After this, for the rest of the day
                cook whenever you like

            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Cook the prepared ingredients</strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                Okay, so after you've mustered up all your strength and courage to get off of whatever youre doing and touch what you left off again, let's get to work. In a big pot, boil your beans
                over medium heat for 30 minutes until soften. while boiling, we can get to scramble the eggs in a pan, then transfer it to a container then cook the sausage. If youre really watching your
                fat intake, i suggest just boil it, but you're one of those people who like ketchup past your 20s just cook them in oil or cooking spray. then also strain the canned lentils and wash
                through water and let dry, that's the extra protein aside from eggs and sausage.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Assemble the concoction</strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                This is the simplest one. In batch or in the largest possible container (could be the pot that you use to boil the beans, that you (hopefully) have cleaned) put everything together and mix.
                Think bibimbap, but its actually not bibimbap and you're actually making human kibble. add in the salt we remember to bring with you to taste, maybe if you really took my korean reference
                into mind yeah mix in Gochujang, and that's it. you finished the cooking
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Portion the dish</strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                Serve this in any container you wish to use, let cool completely outside then keep in the fridge. This should stay good for about 4 days, to store for longer keep in freezer, but i give it
                at most a week. Or just eat the whole thing by yourself, i'm not judging on this one, im a fatty.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
