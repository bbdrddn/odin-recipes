    <h1> Fiddlehead Risotto </h1>
    <h3> (inspired from the game Stardew Valley)</h3>

    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> 
        Fiddleheads are one of the lesser-known seasonal delicacies to cooks and foodies around the world. Growing only for around a few weeks
        during spring then soon to grow into ferns, fiddlehead has a mild earthy taste along with a slight nutty and grassy "green" undertone. In the game 
        <strong><em>Stardew Valley</em></strong>, The spring-exclusive foragable is featured as a main ingredient in a risotto dish, majorly replenishing 
        not just your health but energy  
    </p>

    <p>
        In real life, the challenge to tackling this dish is removing the toxins present in raw fiddleheads by blanching, while still preserving
        its fresh, cooling taste, green color, and its satisfying crunch. The cook (regardless of pro or not) is tasked with controlling not just both
        time and temperature, but also the safety of those they serve this to. However, much like a boss level, successfully completing this dish rewards
        them with not just praise, bragging rights and trust in handling ingredients, but also the confidence and most certainly an "upgrade" to their
        cooking skills.

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul>
        <li><em>200g</em> Arborio rice</li>
        <li><em>150g</em> Fiddleheads </li>
        <li><em>30ml</em> Olive oil</li>
        <li><em>1</em> Small onion</li>
        <li><em>2</em> Garlic cloves</li>
        <li><em>1 liter</em> Vegetable stock or chicken stock</li>
        <li><em>25g</em> Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Instructions </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Clean the fiddleheads</strong>
            <br>
            <p>Thoroughly rinse the fiddleheads under cold water, trim the black bottom parts and the inner spiral
                leaves. (Tip: using your index finger, push the spiral up to reveal the leaves)
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Blanch the fiddleheads</strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                Bring a pot of water to the boil, set a timer for exactly 3 minutes then add in the fiddleheads. After 3 
                minutes, move the fiddleheads to a bowl of ice water or running cold water to preserve crunchiness and color.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the rice</strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                In a shallow pan heat up our olive oil under medium heat, then add in the chopped onion and saute for 5 minutes
                or until translucent. Add in garlic, saute for 1 minute then add in our Arborio rice to toast for 1 - 2 minutes or
                until the rice edges look translucent
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Deglaze the rice</strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                Now, using a splash of our stock of choice or the same measurement of white wine, stir until the liquid is mostly evaporated. 
                Then add in our stock, keep in mind to add one ladle (about 100ml) of stock in at a time, stirring constantly until the liquid
                is absorbed into the rice before repeating for 15 - 20 minutes until the rice is al dente
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Finish with cheese and fiddleheads</strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                After 20 minutes, kill the heat then add in the fiddlehead and mix at the last minute to let its flavor incorporate the 
                risotto but also preserve color and crunch. Then also add in grated Parmesan cheese, which measurement is subject to your
                gluttony.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Serve immediately</strong>
            <br>
            <p>
                On a shallow plate that was heated or showered in hot water, serve a suitable amount of risotto to your guests and family.
                Remember to be generous with the extra grated Parmesan cheese and enjoy as soon as it is served. The fiddlehead taste fine 
                even if it is soft, but the main point of the eating the plant (according to me) is to enjoy its unique crunch.
