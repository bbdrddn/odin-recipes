# odin-recipes
The Odin Project's Fundamental HTML capstone project, where we create a recipe webpage using solely HTML.

--- A FEW WORDS / REFLECTIONS / DEBRIEF BEFORE CONCLUDING THE FUNDAMENTALS OF HTML ---

- STARTING OUT ON THIS PROJECT I ACTUALLY HAD QUITE A HEADSTART. SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF ALREADY WENT THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF HTML BASICS AND CSS THROUGH AN UDEMY COURSE A FRIEND GAVE ME BACK IN 2023 (WHICH AT THAT POINT I STILL HAVE COLD FEET FOR SOME REASON, BUT NO MATTER WE MANAGED TO TYPE SOMETHING DOWN NOW). HOWEVER, AT THAT TIME I WAS NOT VERY SERIOUS AND HONESTLY DID NOT REALLY INDULGE INTO MY FLOW-STATE LEARNING WISE AND SO IT JUST DRIFTS AWAY. THIS TIME AROUND I DID THE VERY OPPOSITE, ALL IT TOOK ME WAS A 7 HOURS STINT WITH A 2 HOUR BREAK IN ADVANCE. AND I NOTED DOWN EVERY KEY THING AND JUST NOT TRY TO TRANSFER TEXT TO PAPER THE ENTIRE LECTURE. BASICALLY MAKING AN ALMANAC OF THE ELEMENTS/TAGS. AND WITHOUT SPIRALING ANY FURTHER, AFTER COMPLETING THIS PROJECT, WE CAN CONCLUDE HTML WITH THE FOLLOWING TECHNIQUES / KNOWLEDGE EARNED:

1. BEING ABLE TO ESTABLISH AN HTML5 BOILERPLATE WETHER MANUALLY OR WITH VSCODE HOTKEY (! + ENTER)

2. BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND, USE AND MODIFY HTML ELEMENTS AND TAGS TO PRESENT INFORMATION

3. BEING ABLE TO MODIFY HTML VOID TAGS AND GIVE IT VALUES , RESULTING IN A TAG DISPLAYING CLICKABLE LINKS, OR PRESENT IMAGES

4. BEING ABLE TO LINK TAGS WITH ABSOLUTE SOURCES (WHICH ARE INTERNET DOMAINS) & RELATIVE SOURCES (WITHIN THE WEBPAGE FILE PATH OR OUTSIDE OF IT)

5. BEING ABLE TO UTILIZE GIT TO STAGE, SAVE CHANGES, COMMIT, AND PUSH THEM TO REMOTE REPOSITORIES LIKE GITHUB

6. BEING ABLE TO WRITE PROFESSIONAL, MEANINGFUL COMMIT MESSAGES
